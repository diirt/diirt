    ** WebPods default mapping file **

      This file allows to map the incoming channel names (as seen from the web
    clients) to local channels and formulas (as seen from the server). It
    allows to translate the name through regular expressions, regulate the
    web pods protocol permissions and authorization.

      The file consists in a list of rules, that are matched at subscription time
    against the incoming channel name and authentication parameters
    (currently only the username).
    The first rule that match a request is used. If no rule is matched,
    no mapping is established and the subscription results in an error.
    It is therefore possible to write rules that are never reachable.
    Each rule is defined through a <mapping> entitity and a series of attributes.

      The incoming channel name can be translated with a regex substitution
    string. This allows to map different parts of the name space to different
    channel datasources or formula patterns. The incoming channel pattern is
    given through the 'channel' attribute and the substitution string is
    given through the 'substitution' attribute. The syntax is the standard
    Java regex syntax, available at:
        http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
    The 'channel' field is mandatory, while the 'substitution' field is optional.
    If the subsitution field is missing, the channel name remains unchanged.

      The 'permission' attribute can have the following values:
    * READ_WRITE - the matched channel can be opened as both read only or read/write
    * READ_ONLY - the matched channel can be opened in read only mode. If
      read/write is requested, the channel will be opened in read only mode.
    * NONE - the matched channel can not be opened
    The 'permission' field is mandatory.

      The 'user' attribute contains a comma separated list of usernames. If
    present, the match is successful only if the subscription is authenticated
    and the username matches one in the list. If missing, any request can
    potentially be a match (i.e. the username is not used during the match).
