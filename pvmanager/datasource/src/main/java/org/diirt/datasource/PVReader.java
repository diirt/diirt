/**
 * An object representing the PVReader. It contains all elements that are common
 * to all PVs of all type. The payload is specified by the generic type,
 * and is returned by {@link #getValue()}. Changes in
 * values are notified through the {@link PVReaderListener}. Listeners
 * can be registered from any thread.
 * <p>
 * The implementation is thread safe, meaning any element (e.g. value, connection, exception, ...)
 * can be accessed from any thread,
 * but there is no guarantee on the atomicity. The only way to work on a consistent
 * snapshot is to use a listener and to process the event on the thread
 * of the listener. If the event is forwarded on another thread, one loses
 * the atomicity and also the other safeguards (like rate throttling).
 * The callback does not lock the object, so other threads can still access
 * the object while listeners are executing.
 * <p>
 * Note that <b>you may get one event after pausing or closing the reader</b>, and there
 * is no plan to address this. The event processing starts with the clearing
 * of the queues. From that moment on, the event processing cannot be stopped
 * without dropping data. The pause could arrive at any moment after that, and
 * at that point the framework has only two choices: send the event anyway
 * or dropping the data which would be forever lost. The first choice is preferable.
 * The third way would be to allow a "roll-back" of the event processing to the
 * state before the event processing started: since each element in the event
 * processing may be stateful, this becomes a non-trivial task. It would also not
 * cover a much simpler hole: the processing may be finished and the pause/stop
 * arrive during the use event callback. At that point, the framework has no control, so
 * you would still have a small chance of part of the callback executed after
 * pausing/closing. The solution there would be to lock the pause/close until
 * after all callbacks are done. This, which was the original implementation, has
 * a severe drawback: it exposes the internal locks and, in conjuction with
 * other badly placed user locks, would introduce deadlocks (user lock -&gt; close[internal lock],
 * callback[internal lock] -&gt; user lock). Given that the point
 * of the library is to make it relative simple for beginners to write multi-threaded
 * correct code, the choice is to avoid the chance of deadlock and let the user
 * deal with the extra possible event.
