 * <ul>
 *   <li>If the expression changes even without external events (e.g. time average),
 *       then the calculation needs to happen at the scan rate</li>
 *   <li>Every time a channel connection or value changes</li>
 *   <li>Every time the expression dynamically changes (e.g. dynamic map, indirect pv)</li>
 * <ul>
